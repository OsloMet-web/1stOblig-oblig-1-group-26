    <h2>2-Huseyin Ozturk  (studentnummer: 383060)</h2>
    <h3>Min første skolen i Norge</h3> 
        
    <p style="font-size:large"> Den siste skolen jeg gikk på var Stabæk videregående skole.
        Skolen vår har en fantastisk historisk bygning og har mange
        fasiliteter. Jeg har brukt treningsstudioet og biblioteket mange
        ganger, spesielt. Skolen gir ekstremt god utdanning. fordi
        voksenopplæring er et vanskelig felt. men lærerne våre var
        forståelses- og løsningsorienterte. Ulempen med skolen er 
        parkeringsproblemet. Parkering er et stort problem da skolen 
        ligger sentralt til. men den kan brukes med buss og tog på grunn 
        av beliggenheten. På denne skolen dro jeg til Norge, jeg lærte mye 
        og fikk gode venner.</p>

    <h2>3-Huseyin Davutoglu (studentnummer: 381403)</h2>
    <h3>My previous chemistry education</h3>
    <p style="font-size:large">I'm Huseyin. I am married and father of 3 children. I have been living in Norway since 2018. I finished bachelor's degree in chemistry in 2006. It was a very difficult but fun education. It was wonderful to have knowledge about matter at the molecular level. I liked the organic chemistry lessons the most. It was a lesson that was as enjoyable as playing a game.
